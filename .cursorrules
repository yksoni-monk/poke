# Cursor Rules for Pokemon Scanner Project

## **CRITICAL DEVELOPMENT RULES - LEARNED FROM EXPERIENCE:**

### **Dependency & Configuration Rules:**
- **ALWAYS check `pyproject.toml` for actual dependencies** - don't assume requirements.txt exists
- **Use `uv` package manager** - not pip (we have `uv.lock` file)
- **Verify package names exactly** - `supertokens-python` not `supertokens`

### **SuperTokens Integration Rules:**
- **Start with minimal configuration** - use `emailpassword.init()` without arguments first
- **Don't guess at configuration** - read actual SuperTokens documentation
- **Test incrementally** - ensure basic setup works before adding complexity
- **Use proven working imports** - stick to what was tested in previous phases

### **Code Quality Rules:**
- **Read the actual documentation** - don't reverse-engineer from old code
- **Start simple and add features gradually** - avoid complex configurations upfront
- **Test each step** - make sure it works before moving to the next
- **Document working configurations** - so we don't forget what actually works
- **READ DOCS FIRST when using any SDK** - if docs not found, ask user for a docs link

### **When Things Go Wrong:**
- **Check actual error messages** - don't assume what the problem is
- **Revert to known working state** - if possible, go back to what worked
- **Simplify, don't complicate** - remove problematic code, don't add more
- **Ask for help early** - don't keep guessing if documentation exists

### **Project-Specific Rules:**
- **Never modify files inside `solid_frontend/src/api` folder** - those are generated files
- **Always use clean code with good architectures and enough comments**
- **Variable names should follow convention with self-explanatory names**
- **We use `pyproject.toml` and `uv.lock`, NOT `requirements.txt`**
- **Package manager is `uv`, not pip**
- **CORS is handled at nginx level, NOT in FastAPI** - don't add CORS middleware to backend

### **SuperTokens Package Details:**
- **Correct package**: `supertokens-python>=0.30.0`
- **Working recipe**: `emailpassword` (NOT `passwordless`)
- **Import pattern**: `from supertokens_python import ...`
- **Start minimal**: `emailpassword.init()` and `session.init()` without arguments
